# Vital Signs Radar Dataset & Code  
**Welcome to the Vital Signs Radar Dataset & Code**  
This folder contains the code related to estimating vital signs such as heart rate and breathing rate using radar signals. It focuses on using radar systems for non-invasive monitoring of physiological parameters.

---

## üöÄ Overview  
Radar-based vital sign detection provides a unique and contactless way to monitor health conditions, particularly useful for remote healthcare and surveillance. This section includes:

- **üíª Code**: Python code for processing the radar data and estimating heart rate (bpm) and breathing rate (bpm).

The code is designed for research and educational purposes in radar signal processing and health monitoring.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Prerequisites  
Before using the code, please ensure that the following requirements are met:

1. **Install Infineon RadarSDK**  
   The code requires the **Infineon RadarSDK** to be installed. You can download it from the official site:  
   [Infineon RadarSDK](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.ifxradarsdk)

2. **Install Python Wheels**  
   After installing the RadarSDK, you will also need to install the `python_wheels` package provided with the SDK.

3. **Python Version**  
   The code was tested with **Python 3.12**. Please ensure you are using this version or compatible versions for optimal performance.
