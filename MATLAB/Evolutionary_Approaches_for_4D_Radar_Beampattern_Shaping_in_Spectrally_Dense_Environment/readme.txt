## üöÄ Overview

This repository includes the simulation codes developed for the paper, where evolutionary algorithms (GA, PSO, SA, CMAES) are applied to 4D radar beampattern shaping in spectrally dense environments. The objective is to optimize radar beampatterns for improved performance in the presence of interference and spectrally crowded environments. This work extends the state-of-the-art in MIMO radar waveform design and signal processing for advanced radar systems.

### Key Components:
- **Comparative Spectral Results**: Data comparing the spectral results of different methods, including recent studies in radar waveform design and coexistence with communications.
- **Optimization Functions**: Functions for performing optimization processes (Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES)).
- **Objective Functions**: Spatial and spectral objective functions used in the optimization process.
- **Main Script**: The script that reproduces the results and generates the figures discussed in the paper.
