# Designing Sets of Binary Sequences for MIMO Radar Systems MATLAB Code

This repository contains MATLAB code developed to support the findings and methodologies presented in the paper titled:

**"Designing Sets of Binary Sequences for MIMO Radar Systems"**  
Published in *IEEE Transactions on Radar Systems*  
DOI: [10.1109/TRS.2019.8706639](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8706639)

The code is designed to reproduce the results and figures discussed in the paper, providing hands-on experience to understand and evaluate the proposed binary sequence design technique for MIMO radar systems.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository includes tools for designing and evaluating sets of binary sequences specifically for MIMO radar systems. The approach focuses on improving radar performance by generating optimal binary sequences that enhance radar waveform design, targeting better resolution and detection capabilities.

### Main Features:
- **Binary Sequence Design**: Implementation of the proposed binary sequence design method for MIMO radar systems.
- **MIMO Radar Simulations**: Simulate MIMO radar systems using the designed binary sequences for improved performance.
- **Result Reproduction**: Reproduce figures and results discussed in the paper.

## üî• Getting Started

### Main Functionality

The core function of the binary sequence design method is contained in the **`main functions`** folder. The main files designed for this paper are:

- **`dpmMIMO.m`**: This script is used for designing a set of discrete phase sequences that exhibit good Peak-to-Sidelobe Ratio (PSL) and Inter-Symbol Leakage (ISL), which are crucial for effective MIMO radar systems.

Users interested in exploring the methodology further are encouraged to check out the code in these main files.
