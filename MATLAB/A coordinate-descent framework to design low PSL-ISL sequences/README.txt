# Coordinate-Descent Framework to Design Low PSL/ISL Sequences

This repository contains MATLAB code designed to implement the coordinate-descent framework for designing low Peak-to-Sidelobe (PSL) and Inter-Sidelobe (ISL) sequences. The methods are described in the paper:

**"A Coordinate-Descent Framework to Design Low PSL/ISL Sequences"**  
IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 65, no. 22, pp. 5942-5956, Nov. 15, 2017.

## üöÄ Overview

The code implements algorithms for designing sequences with low PSL and ISL, which are critical for radar and communication systems. The main functions are:

- **`cpm.m`**: Designs constant modulus sequences.
- **`lpCPM.m`**: Initializes continuous phase for PSL minimization.
- **`dpm.m`**: Designs discrete phase sequences, including binary sequences.
- **`lpDPM.m`**: Initializes discrete phase for PSL minimization, including binary sequences.

## üìä Reproducing the Figures

To reproduce the figures reported in the paper, you can run the script **`FigTSP2017.m`**.

This script generates the figures presented in the paper and demonstrates the effectiveness of the coordinate-descent framework.
