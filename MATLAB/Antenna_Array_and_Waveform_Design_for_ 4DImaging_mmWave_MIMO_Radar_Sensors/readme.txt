## üöÄ Overview

The code in this repository provides a set of functions for the design and simulation of antenna arrays and waveforms that optimize performance in 4D imaging radar systems. These systems operate in mmWave frequencies and employ MIMO techniques to achieve high-resolution and accurate imaging.

### Main Features:
- **Antenna Array Design**: Tools to design MIMO antenna arrays for radar systems operating at mmWave frequencies.
- **Waveform Optimization**: Methods for optimizing radar waveforms for enhanced 4D imaging performance.
- **4D Imaging Techniques**: Approaches for achieving high-resolution spatial and temporal imaging.

The key functions and scripts include:

- **`antennaArrayDesign.m`**: Function to design antenna arrays for 4D mmWave MIMO radar.
- **`waveformDesign.m`**: Function to design radar waveforms tailored for 4D imaging systems.
- **`4DImagingSimulation.m`**: Simulation of the radar system performance in a 4D imaging scenario.

## üìä Reproducing the Figures and Results

To reproduce the figures and results from the paper or research on the antenna array and waveform design for 4D imaging radar systems, simply run the script **`simulate4DImaging.m`**. This script uses the core functions to simulate a radar system and generate relevant performance metrics.
