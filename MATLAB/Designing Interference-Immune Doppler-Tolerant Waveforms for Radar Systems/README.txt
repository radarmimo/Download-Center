# Designing Interference-Immune Doppler-Tolerant Waveforms for Radar Systems

This repository contains MATLAB code developed to support the findings and methodologies presented in the paper titled:

**"Designing Interference-Immune Doppler-Tolerant Waveforms for Radar Systems"**  
Published in *IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (TAES)*  
DOI: [10.1109/TAES.2022.9928573](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9928573)


## üöÄ Overview

This repository includes tools for designing optimized waveform sequences that combine the Doppler-tolerant characteristics of Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) waveforms with the interference-immune properties of tailored polyphase sequences. The approach is based on the majorization‚Äìminimization framework and uses Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL) and Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL) cost functions to optimize the waveform design.

### Main Features:
- **Waveform Design for Dynamic Detection**: Code to design sequences with Doppler-tolerant characteristics, similar to LFM waveforms, combined with minimal PSL/ISL and interference immunity similar to polyphase sequences.
- **Optimized Sequences**: The optimization considers parameters like degree Q of polynomial phase behavior, subsequence length M, and the total number of subsequences L to achieve optimal Doppler tolerance and low cross-correlation.
- **Automotive Application**: The method is demonstrated for an automotive scenario to showcase its practical application in real-world radar systems.

## üî• Getting Started

### Main Functionality

The core function of the proposed waveform design method is contained in the **`main functions`** folder. The main file designed for this paper is:

- **`PECS.m`**: This script implements the majorization‚Äìminimization framework to design Doppler-tolerant waveforms with minimal PSL/ISL. It optimizes the sequence design based on the parameters mentioned in the paper, including the degree of polynomial phase behavior and subsequence characteristics.

Users interested in exploring the methodology further are encouraged to check out the code in this file.
