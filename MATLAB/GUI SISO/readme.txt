# GUI SISO Waveform Optimization Tool

Welcome to the **GUI SISO Waveform Optimization Tool**, designed to streamline waveform design using the **Continuous Phase Constraint (CPM)** and **Discrete Phase Constraint (DPM)** algorithms. This graphical user interface (GUI) enables you to effortlessly generate optimized waveforms tailored to your specific requirements.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Launch the GUI**: 
   - Open MATLAB and execute the `mSISO.m` script to launch the GUI.

2. **Select an Algorithm**: 
   - Choose either the **CPM** or **DPM** algorithm based on your optimization goals.

3. **Input the Initial Sequence**: 
   - Provide the initial sequence that you wish to optimize.

4. **Run the Optimization**: 
   - Click the "Run Optimization" button to start the optimization process.

## üîß Algorithm Selection

### **CPM (Continuous Phase Constraint)**
- **Objective**: Minimize the Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL) or Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL) while ensuring phase continuity.
- **Features**: 
   - Optimizes the waveform by minimizing sidelobes.
   - Enforces a unimodular constraint for phase continuity across the sequence.

### **DPM (Discrete Phase Constraint)**
- **Objective**: Select an optimal waveform from a predefined alphabet of discrete phase values, aiming to minimize PSL or ISL.
- **Features**:
   - Utilizes a set of discrete phase values for the waveform design.
   - Focuses on optimizing sidelobe levels within the given constraints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Using the GUI SISO Tool

1. **Select the Optimization Algorithm**: 
   - Choose either **CPM** or **DPM** from the dropdown menu based on your waveform optimization needs.

2. **Input the Initial Sequence**: 
   - Input a sequence that will serve as the starting point for optimization. The GUI will optimize this sequence based on the selected algorithm.

3. **Configure Parameters**: 
   - Set any additional parameters specific to the algorithm, such as optimization weights, phase alphabet (for DPM), and other configurations.

4. **Run the Optimization**: 
   - Click the "Run Optimization" button to initiate the optimization process. The algorithm will be applied to the input sequence.

5. **View the Results**: 
   - Once the optimization is complete, the GUI will display the optimized waveform along with key metrics such as **Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL)**, **Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL)**, and other relevant optimization results.

## üí° Tips

- Ensure that all relevant files are in the same directory as `mSISO.m` to avoid errors.
- The optimization results will be displayed immediately after running the process. You can save the results for further analysis.
