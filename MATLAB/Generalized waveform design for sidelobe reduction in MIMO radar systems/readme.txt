## üöÄ Overview

This repository includes the code used in the paper, which focuses on generalized waveform design for sidelobe reduction in MIMO radar systems. Specifically, the paper presents a design methodology for phase-only (constant modulus) sequences with low Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL) and Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL), optimizing radar performance by reducing sidelobes and improving target detection.

### Key Aspects of the Paper:
- **Optimization of Phase-Only Sequences**: The work minimizes the weighted \( \ell_{p} \)-norm of the auto- and cross-correlation sidelobes to reduce PSL and ISL.
- **BSUM Algorithm**: Block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) is used to solve the non-convex, NP-hard optimization problem.
- **Unimodular Sequences**: The paper focuses on unimodular sequences that are suitable for practical radar systems with amplifier constraints.
- **Performance**: The optimized sequences outperform state-of-the-art counterparts both in terms of PSL and computational time.
