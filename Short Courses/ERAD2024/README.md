## üìù Abstract

The meteorological industry is transitioning towards **Solid State Weather Radar (SSWR)** systems, which emit minimal transmission power to reduce environmental impact and system costs. However, accurately estimating reflectivity for each polarization and reducing the blind range pose significant challenges for SSWR systems utilizing pulse compression.

This short course will explore **advanced radar waveform design and optimization techniques**, focusing on **Pulse Compression**, **Integrated Side Lobe (ISL) mitigation**, and **Peak Side Lobe (PSL) reduction**. Participants will gain insights into radar waveform fundamentals, techniques for mitigating ISL and reducing PSL, and principles of waveform diversity in **MIMO radar systems**. Practical demonstrations using real weather radar data will provide a comprehensive understanding of these principles.

## üéØ Course Goals

By the end of this course, participants will:

- Familiarize themselves with advanced radar waveforms, including **Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM)**, **binary phase sequences**, and **polyphase sequences**.
- Learn key **metrics** for quantifying the performance of different radar waveforms, with a focus on weather radar applications.
- Understand the basics of **convex** and **nonconvex optimization techniques**, including **coordinate descent (CD)**, **gradient descent (GD)**, and **majorization minimization (MM)**.
- Apply **nonconvex optimization techniques** to design weather radar waveforms and improve sensitivity and accuracy in pulse compression.
- Comprehend the **principles and benefits** of waveform diversity in **MIMO radar systems**.
