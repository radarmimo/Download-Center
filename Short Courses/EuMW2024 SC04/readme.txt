## üìù Abstract

Radar waveform design is essential for enhancing the performance of radar systems, including **MIMO radar** applications. This short course will cover advanced radar waveform optimization techniques, focusing on **waveform types** such as **CW**, **FMCW**, **PMCW**, and **phase-coded waveforms**. The course will begin by introducing **Single-Input Single-Output (SISO)** radar systems, including the essential concepts of **phased array radar**. Participants will learn about optimization strategies for improving radar performance, such as **Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL)** and **Integrated Sidelobe Level (ISL)**.

The course will further delve into **MIMO radar systems**, exploring multiplexing schemes like **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**, **Binary Phase Modulation (BPM)**, and **Doppler Division Multiplexing (DDM)**. Additionally, the course will cover advanced **non-convex optimization** techniques such as **coordinate descent**, **gradient descent**, and **majorization minimization** to design efficient waveforms for radar applications. Insights into **4D-imaging MIMO radar**, **beampattern shaping**, and **target classification enhancement** will also be provided, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of radar waveform optimization.
